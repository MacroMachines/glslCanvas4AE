# glslCanvas4AE

![](./Assets/screenshot.gif)

After Effects plug-in to run codes written at [The Book of Shaders Editor](http://editor.thebookofshaders.com/).

**NOTE: This codes is working in progress and has many problems yet. I'm focusing on building the plug-in only for latest AE on macOS at first, and then prepare for other environment. It would be awesome if you contribute this project to support Windows!**

## How to Build

1. Download [AE SDK CC 2017 for macOS](https://console.adobe.io/downloads/ae).
2. Put the SDK folder at the same directory as cloned folder of this repository and rename it to "SDK" like below:
    ```
    (parent folder)
        ├ glslCanvas4AE
        └ SDK
    ```
